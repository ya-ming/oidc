node authorizationServer.js
# OIDC Authorization Server is listening at http://20.0.0.25:9001
# http://20.0.0.25:9001/.well-known/openid-configuration

node protectedResource.js
# OIDC Resource Server is listening at http://30.0.0.30:9002

node client.js
# OIDC Client is listening at http://10.0.0.10:9000
